William Kelly


	On October 2, 2019, William went to Wendt to complete x2. It was lit. He and his teammates 
dabbed on the assignment.
	Caroline sat across the table. She was hungry. She planned a dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. Is the cheese in her refrigerator expired? Time will tell.
Eric reflected on his adventures last night. He went to the bars and got (legally) blitzed with his friends. He watched the Brewers lose their playoff game in heart-breaking fashion. He didn't drink any water when her got home, Today, he regretted all of it.
