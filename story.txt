William Kelly


	On October 2, 2019, William went to Wendt to complete x2. It was lit. He and his teammates 
dabbed on the assignment.
	Caroline sat across the table. She was hungry. She planned a dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. Is the cheese in her refrigerator expired? Time will tell.
Eric reflected on his adventures last night. He went to the bars and got (legally) blitzed with his friends. He watched the Brewers lose their playoff game in heart-breaking fashion. He didn't drink any water when her got home, Today, he regretted all of it.

	As all of this is happening, Ammar was sitting across the table, working slowly as he began formulating plans for the evening. Dinner was the primary focus, consisting of ideas for different dishes including a revolutionary cup of ramen  in flavored water, or a cup of mac and cheese with taco meat. Of course, not being a cook, none of this really mattered. What did matter were the important questions in his life: "Why do we drive on a parkway and park on the driveway?Are the 'e's in "bee" silent? Why are we here? Do crabs think fish can fly?" These questions consume his thoughts, as he slowly descends into madness.
In the meantime, Harry is thinking about the reading he has to do tonight, and complaining about the fact that we have to learn linux command line.
